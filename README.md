# Two Components, One Model

How do you listen to changes from one component to another? Easy!
Share a model.

want to observe model objects. You can bind a single model instance
into multiple components.

This sample uses [Dart](http://dartlang.org) and [Web UI](http://www.dartlang.org/articles/web-ui/).
